Time Arena Description:

This game is (to the best of our knowledge) the first fluid, mostly unrestricted, time-travel game. There are two teams: miners must collect crystals whilst guardians try to catch the miners, forcing them to drop their crystals. If the miners collect more than ten crystals by the end of the game, they win; otherwise the guardians win. Collectable crystals are generated at random times and places throughout the arena and they only exist for a short window of time. Large blocker crystals grow and break throughout the game, preventing access to some regions of the map. All players should time travel to get around the blockers and miners should time travel to collect crystals in the time windows where they exist.


Deployment Instructions:

1. Follow the instructions at the following link to download the Unity Hub and install Unity version 2020.3.27f1.
https://unity.com/download

2. Download Autodesk Maya (this step is likely no longer needed since we made efforts to convert final asset files to OBJ).
https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription

3. With Unity Hub running, select "open" and then navigate to the "time-arena" folder. Select "time-arena-game".

4. To build the project for desktop, go to "file->Build Settings". Make sure "PC, Mac & Linux Standalone" is selected as the platform. Click the "Switch platform" button if it appears at the bottom. Finally press "Build and Run" to compile and run the game.

5. To deploy the project as a web game, select "WebGL" as the platform, press "Switch Platform" if necessary and finally press "Build". Compress the generated folder to a ZIP file. Create an itch.io account. Go to "Dashboard", then select "Create new project". Fill out the fields and importantly, under uploads, upload the generated zip file. Finally, press "Save & view page" to access the finished project.
